<p style= “font-family:courier; font-size:150%;”>Hi, My name is Princess Ahby Therese M. Ylagan. I'm studying at Saint Rita College Manila and I am a Grade 7th Student. I live in Sampaloc, Manila with 3 people and 4 dogs. This 2022, time has passed by and there is now a new virus called Omicron which is very contagious to people. So the virus is evolving as well. Not only days are changing but also people as well and one of those people is me. So in this web page, I’ll tell you a few changes that happened to me. I’m learning the ukulele now because I wanted to try something new and it’s because we haven’t used the ukulele for 4 years which is pretty long. I don’t take French lessons anymore because it’s pretty hard to learn and I’ve already deleted my French lesson app. It’s also reducing the space in my tablet so I had to delete it. I’m also liking this series called “Steven Universe” which I found interesting to watch. In online class, I know how to manage my time between doing assignments and my leisure time. I’ve improved more with my drawing skills. I’m growing taller and I’ve been eating a lot. And this year, I’m turning 13. So I guess that’s all I want to say about some changes about myself.
