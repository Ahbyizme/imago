<p style="font-size:150%;">Hello and Good Day! The reason I like this video is becuse first of all it's an animatic of The Owl House which is made by a random animator. And I like the graphics and movements and it is only mde by him or her nd to be honest, it's really good and it's creative. The drawing is so good and nice, it looks exactly like the characters in the real show. Second, it's my fvorite episode in The Owl House where Hunters identity is reveal plus, it's my favorite show. Third, the song The Other Side is from the Greatest Showman. It's a movie about a man who has big dreams, it's more like a musical movie. The other songs there as well is the Greatest Show, Million Dreams, Rewrite the Stars, From Now On and This is Me, it's a pretty good movie. Last of all, the song suits the animatic of the video which is making it related to the video. Anyways, that's all the reason why I like this youtube video. I also forgot Sir Jefferson, please click the "Watch on YouTube" link so you can watch it becuse, it says Video unavailable. Thank you and stay safe!
